Question: If you invested $5 in bitcoin every single day, how would your portfolio look after six years?


Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avinashmynampati/bitcoin-price-and-fear-greed-index-20182024/data


With this dataset, no cleaning was required. I simply took the csv and loaded it into rust.


Functionality:


The struct “BitcoinData” sets up the database and contains all columns in the database along with their data types.


The struct “InvestmentResult” contains off of the variables I will be finding and need for the final report.


calc_type() runs all of the calculations needed for the final result


print_result() sets up all the lines to be printed for a single investment


main() uses calc_type() to run all of the calculations for each investment then print_result() to print all of the results


Tests: 


does_filter_work() adds 3 random days with different sentiments then makes sure the code is filtering out the settlements we don’t want when making its output


does_every_other_work()  adds 4 concurrent days to check that when only investing every other day we actually are doing every other day instead of something else like only the first half of the data




Output: 
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.49s
     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/debug/deps/finalpro-70d6bb9b81c96343)

Investing $5 a day is a beginner investment strategy that gained popularity a few years ago. This is because when investing everyday, you are betting on the stock price steadily increasing over time, and are basically evening out any volatility in the investment. I thought it would be fun to see how much a person would make doing this with bitcoin, which has exploded in price over recent years. I also wanted to see if you’d be a smarter investor trading when the fear-greed index, a metric that tries to predict if the market is overvalued or not, was high or low. I also included how much you would have needed to invest per day to make 10k or 5x your investment to show that only a small amount could have a huge effect with something as hot as bitcoin. Overall it found that a person investing just $5 every day over the six year stretch in the data would leave them with almost 50k in profit, not bad for the price of a coffee (in Boston) everyday.
